# Pokemon Battle

As part of a Code First Girls; Python & Apps course project, I developed this game entirely from scratch over a two-week period. In the game, the user competes against a computer opponent, with each participant having three randomly selected Pokémon and three assigned moves. The game proceeds in turns until one of the players exhausts their party of Pokémon.

### Built with:
- Python
- pokeAPI
- JSON data manipulation

Your can run the game from main.py, please make sure that you install 'requests' library for the programme to run properly, you can do so by running this command in your project terminal: pip install requests
